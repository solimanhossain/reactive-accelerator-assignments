# Assignment 7 MovieDB

## Done by Soliman Hossain

> For all movies list create a api `/api/movies` endpoint for GET request not connected to UI

> For individual movie id create api endpoint `/api/movie/{id}` for GET, PATCH (only for title), DELETE request

> Dynamic import json file used from given file to coverted json and no use of fetch api

> Onclick individual details button open movie details modal and shows URL routeas `/movies/:movieId` where implement parallel and intercepting routing so that after reload it show details page not modal

> Create "This movie with {movieId} id was not found!" Not found page single movie and aslo common not found page for all others.

> Multi-language implement uisng middleware and here using language json file to support 2 languages, there a option on navbar to change language preference but by default auto language selected.
